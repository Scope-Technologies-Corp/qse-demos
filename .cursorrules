# Cursor Rules for QSE Demos Project

## Git Workflow Rules

When working with Git, always follow these rules:

### Starting New Work
- Always start from an up-to-date main branch
- Commands: `git checkout main && git pull origin main && git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
- Never create a branch without first pulling latest main

### After PR is Merged
- Switch back to main and pull latest changes
- Commands: `git checkout main && git pull origin main && git branch -d feature/name && git push origin --delete feature/name`
- Always clean up merged branches (both local and remote)

### Starting Next Feature
- Always pull main first: `git checkout main && git pull origin main`
- Then create new branch: `git checkout -b feature/next-feature-name`

### Key Principles
1. **Never commit directly to main** - always use feature branches
2. **Always pull main before creating new branch** - prevents merge conflicts
3. **Clean up merged branches** - keeps repository tidy
4. **Resolve conflicts on feature branch** - never on main

### If Merge Conflicts Occur
- Resolve conflicts on the feature branch, not main
- Use `git rebase main` or `git merge main` on feature branch
- Never force push to main

## Code Style
- Follow existing code patterns in the project
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Keep commits focused and atomic

## Project-Specific Notes
- Dieharder source files should be ignored (cloned during build)
- Only custom integration scripts should be committed
- Docker files are part of the deployment setup
